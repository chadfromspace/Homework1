Horiseon  Website Code Cleanup

The aim of this project was to add semantic HTML elements where applicable,
as well as to comment, format, and consolidate the code of the original index.html
and style.css files.

*Additional Notes*

- Darkened the gray 'seo' portion of the main Horiseon logo (#aaaaaa)
- Changed the copyright symbol in the footer to the alternate numerical code
